# Intro
In light of the "save-the-world" movement, the codes snippet allow Shopify store owners to offer gift box only on the customers' request.


# How it works
1. Be default, the order will be opt-out of receving a free gift box on the cart page.
2. If the opt-out option is unchecked by the customer, the gift box will be added into the cart page.


# Remarks
Effectively, we are reversing the behaviour of the original "**Add a gift-wrap option to your cart page**" - [see here](http://docs.shopify.com/manual/configuration/store-customization/page-specific/cart-page/add-a-gift-wrap-option)

# Instructions
Pls note to replace the word "gift wrapping/wrap" to "gift box" where applicable when following the instructions in the guide.
